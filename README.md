## current projects

- [personal neocities site:](https://github.com/panasonic-hum/astro_neocities) I used astro to build a static site. I wasn't exactly trying to match the 90s aesthetic of old geocities, but I was trying to make a no frills site to better understand html and css. Learning astro was also a fun challenge and I will definitely use astro for future projects.
- [manga manager](https://github.com/panasonic-hum/manga_manager) **(WIP)**: This is my current project to build a custom manga reading progress tracker, similar to my anime list. I'm building a python backend using fastapi and will probably use react for the frontend.
