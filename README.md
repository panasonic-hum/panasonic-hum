## Hello, guests

I'm Shelby (she/her), a QA tester interested in learning code. I'm working on some personal projects so I can learn, mess up in a low stakes way, and grow my skills.

## current projects

- [personal neocities site:](https://github.com/panasonic-hum/astro_neocities) Static site built via Astro. I wasn't exactly trying to match the 90s aesthetic of old geocities, but I was trying to make a no frills site to better understand html and css. Learning Astro was also a fun challenge and it's a great tool, I definitely plan on using it for other projects.
- [manga manager](https://github.com/panasonic-hum/manga_manager) **(WIP)**: This is my current project to build a custom manga reading progress tracker, similar to my anime list. I'm building a python backend using fastapi and will probably use react for the frontend.
